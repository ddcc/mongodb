 * DeadlineMonitor

 * or _Task::kill() will be called when the deadline arrives.
 *
 * Each instance of a DeadlineMonitor spawns a thread which waits for one of the
 * following conditions:
 *    - a task is added to the monitor
 *    - a task is removed from the monitor
 *    - the nearest deadline has arrived
 *
 * Ownership:
 * The _Task* must not be freed until the deadline has elapsed or stopDeadline()
 * has been called.
 *
 * NOTE: Each instance of this class spawns a new thread.  It is intended to be a stop-gap
 *       solution for simple deadline monitoring until a more robust solution can be
 *       implemented.
 *
 * NOTE: timing is based on wallclock time, which may not be precise.
