"""
Alternative to the threading.Timer class.

Enables a timer to be restarted without needing to construct a new
thread each time. This is necessary to execute periodic actions, e.g.
flushing log messages to buildlogger, while avoiding errors related to
"can't start new thread" that would otherwise occur on Windows.
